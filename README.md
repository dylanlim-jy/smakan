# The SMACC Makan App
Hello! The inspiration for creating this app was to make coordinating post-service dinner meet-ups easier.

This is a simple polling app written in [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/), without any front-end framework, using [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/). It uses gunicorn as the WSGI server and nginx to serve static files. Huge thanks to [Dot JA's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJAfq6Ku4cI) on deploying Django apps!

More docs to come soon.
